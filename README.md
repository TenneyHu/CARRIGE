# CARRIAGE 🍜
**Cross-culturAl Recipe Retrieval and adaptatIon with Augmented Generation Enhancement**

CARRIAGE is a plug-and-play Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed for **cross-cultural recipe adaptation**. It enhances both **retrieval** and **context organization** to generate **diverse** and **culturally appropriate** recipe variants based on user preferences.

> ✨ Our framework addresses the limitation of standard RAG systems in generating creative, diverse outputs by explicitly modeling context diversity.
